This essay is aimed at developing an algorithm for parsing expressions in a context where it is possible to define custom operators along with their precedences.  Since we can't name the operators, we have to use a technique which is not commonly use for defining the syntax of languages.  As far as I know, the technique did not exist prior to the redaction of this essay.  We have to use parameterized production rules.  

\begin{grammar} 
		[(colon){$\rightarrow$}] 
		[(semicolon){ $\\ \quad | \quad$}] 
		[(period){\\}] 
		[(quote){Ô}{Õ}] 
	expr (oper)  : expr (prec"."op) op expr (prec"."op)  \\
	$\qquad$ with $op \in oper$
	; 'word'
\end{grammar}
